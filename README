Feb 23 Test comments with l1_norm.png and l2_norm.png outputs
Changing the distance metric between two classes changes the output of basis returned by the algorithm.
L1 norm is pretty bad (and not even suggested by the paper)
L2 norm is making more sense with nodes near function variability are lighting up in the output.
